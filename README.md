        Every day, we make decisions that affect not only our environment, but the climate, wildlife, and most importantly, individuals around the world. This notion creates a discrepancy between expectations and reality because people are not taking the right actions to live a more sustainable lifestyle and do not realize that some of their actions are harming our planet. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> Solution </h3>
    <p>
        As a mobile app development business, Eko will help users make their everyday routine more sustainable. Eko will produce an app that will help users make their everyday routine more sustainable. The app will guide users to perform environmental tasks and provide data that will help individuals see the positive impact they are making.
