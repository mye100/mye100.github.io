    <h2> About Eko </h2>

    <h3> Problem </h3>
    <p>
        Every day, we make decisions that affect not only our environment, but the climate, wildlife, and most importantly, individuals around the world. This notion creates a discrepancy between expectations and reality because people are not taking the right actions to live a more sustainable lifestyle and do not realize that some of their actions are harming our planet. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> Solution </h3>
    <p>
        As a mobile app development business, Eko will help users make their everyday routine more sustainable. Eko will produce an app that will help users make their everyday routine more sustainable. The app will guide users to perform environmental tasks and provide data that will help individuals see the positive impact they are making. The app will bring communities one step closer to an eco-friendly generation.
        When people start to use the app, they will discover new ways to go green by performing environmental tasks and earning points and rewards; allowing them to see the positive impact they are making. In addition, it will become a habit for them to continue taking these environmental actions for the benefit of their community, planet, and saving money.  
    </p>
